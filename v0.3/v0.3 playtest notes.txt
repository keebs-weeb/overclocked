v0.3 Playtest Notes

Monster Fights Action Spaces should be as many in a row as you would like to draw, but you keep your health between each fight
	Must declare how many to fight before the fight

Changes To Card economy:
	No System Settings Interactions, allow player interactions to happen without need of any other card
		Scriptkiddie, Metasploit, Youtube Hacking Tutorial
	Test Combining Mods and System Settings decks together?
	Test drawing 1 system setting for free each turn?
	Lower Card Cost to 4

Shrink board to 50/40 spaces

Try to change boss/monster stats
	Change all damage and health to small numbers, ignoring the need to do any real math (ie max health = 4, boss does 2 damage)
	This will need a complete health overhaul for mods too
	
New System Setting Card: (NOT NEEDED IF REMOVING ALL INTERACTIONS WITH SYSTEM SETTINGS)
