## Game Summary
Grab your favorite computer and play "The Game" with your friends!  First one to beat the game wins, so install Mods wisely and hack your friends in order to push yourself to victory!

---
## Game Objectives
Your goal is to beat "The Game" before anyone else in your LAN party does.  In order to do so, you must have a careful balance of installing Mods (that can make the game easier but less rewarding, or harder and more rewarding) and moving spaces.

In "The Game", enemies and bosses appear that you must defeat to progress and will give you coins.  
> See Section '[Coins](#coins)' for more information

Everyone's computers have the ability to install Mods on your system, making you more powerful.  You can also grief your "friends" by giving them viruses!
> See Section '[Mods](#mods)' for more information

If your computer has too many Mods installed on it, it can crash, reverting your progress to the last saved location in "The Game".
> See Section '[Crashing](#crashing)' for more information

## Starting Gameplay
1. In order of how expensive a player's real life computer costs, each player picks a computer to use for the game
2. Each player draws 3 Mods from the deck, can install one for free (or keep it in their 'Mods Folder'), and then the rest are shuffled back into the deck. 
    > See Section '[Mods Folder](#mods-folder)' for more information
3. Each player draws 4 System Settings cards rom the deck into their hand.
4. Each player gets 5 coins and puts them in their 'Reliable' coins space
5. One (1) Boss monster is drawn and placed face down on the boss monster spaces on the player's board

## Gameplay Loop
**Starting Phase:**

Starting with the player with the worst computer, that player chooses to either enter the play phase, or skip it and go to the maintenance phase.

**Play Phase:**

Players roll their movement dice and move that many spaces in "The Game".  The minimum movement that can be rolled (with any negative modificatins) is 1.  During the play phase, if a player would pass over any 'Action Spaces', they may choose to stp their movement on that square and take that action.
> See Section '[Action Spaces](#action-spaces)' for more information
If a player would pass over any boss spaces, the character stops and has to fight the enemy.
> See Section '[Battles](#battles)' for more information

**Event Phase:**

If a player lands on a blank space after movement, they draw a card from the 'Events' deck and performs any actions required by that card
> See Section '[Event Deck](#event-deck)' for more information

The event phase does not activate if the character does not move, stops on an Action Space, or stops on a Boss Space.

**Maintenance Phase:**

After performing space actions, the player is then able to purchase Mods, install or uninstall Mods, activate cards, configure system settings, and end their turn (per computer specs).
> See Section '[Maintenance](#maintenance)' for more information

**End Turn Phase:**
Temporary effects are removed from the player's board, and discarded.  The turn passes to the player to the left (clockwise).

## Basic Rules
### "The Game"
```
"The Game" is represented with the 100 space board, and is where players move their characters, fight enemeies, and collect coins.  In order to beat "The Game", a player's character must defeat the final boss on space 100.  After this happens, the game is over and that player wins the game.

During "The Game", a player will often times fight enemies such as monsters and bosses.  If a player wins the fight, then they are often awarded coins.  If a player loses the fight, then they will be sent back to the last 'Checkpoint' square that they passed.

There are many spaces on "The Game" board that players can pass over or stop on, that all have different actions and events that happen on.  You can read more about these spaces in the section "The Game" in the advanced rules.
```
### Player Characters
```
At the start of play, each player chooses a character to play with out of the 4 base options.  These characters have different stats to promote a different playstyle.

Characters level up each time they defeat a boss and cannot ever lose levels.  When a character levels up, their stats are increased by whatever their "Level Up" values show.  A basic calcuation of a character's current stats is: BaseStat + (LevelUpValue * CurrentLevel).

Player characters fight enemies, which is described in the section "Battles" further down this document.
```
### Player's Hands
```
A player's hand is a private area that is where System Settings cards are held.  A player can only hold 5 cards at a time, and if they would like to add another card they must first discard one card, and then draw the new card.
```
### Battles
```
When a character is fighting in "The Game", the following actions occur:
    - The player rolls a D12, and adds in their Damage modifications from their character's base stats, level up stats, and installed mods.
    - That damage is done to the enemy, and if this kills the enemy the fight is over and the player character wins the fight.
    - The enemy then does damage equal to their value to the player character, and if this kills the character they lose the fight.

Upon losing the fight, that player loses all of their 'unreliable' coins.  They then can choose any off the previously passed checkpoints to restore to, and on their next play phase they will move from there.  Bosses are NOT fought again if they have been defeated previously.
```
### Computers
```
Computers are the main tools that players work on, as they run "The Game".  These are chosen at the beginning of gameplay and cannot be changed during game. Each computer has a set amount of "Bandwidth" that determines how many actions can be taken during the Maintenance phase.

Each computer has a limited number of system resources that are used to install mods with. There are no max limits of how many mods can be installed, but all installed mods must have unique names, no duplicates are allowed.

Each computer can have 2 System Settings cards installed at any given time.  These also must be unique in names, and to install a third System Setting a currently installed one must be removed and discarded.
```
### Mods, System Settings, and Event Cards
```
These cards are located in their respective decks, and are drawn at certain times during the game.  These cards are the primary methods to augment progress in "The Game", and interaction between players.

Mods:
    - Purchased during a player's Maintenance phase
    - Can be installed to your computer, or to other's computers if you control a relavant System Setting card.
    - The amount of System Resources each mod takes up on a computer is shown in the top right of that card

System Settings:
    - Purchased during a player's Maintenance phase
    - Can be installed to your computer, or to other's computers if you control a relavant System Setting card.
    - Come in two flavors, "Single Use" or "Permanent".  Single Use cards are played, their abilities are used, and then they are discarded.  Permanent cards are played onto a computer, and remain there until discarded due to player choice or an activated ability
    - A maximum of 2 Permanents can be installed on each computer, and cannot be duplicates

Event Cards:
    - Drawn when a player lands on a blank space in "The Game" or an ability is triggered
    - Contains events such as temporary buffs, free coins, or additional card draw
    - When drawn, their effects activate immediately and are then discarded unless otherwise instructed
