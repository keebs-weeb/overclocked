## Game Summary
Grab your favorite computer and play "The Game" with your friends!  First one to beat the game wins, so install Mods wisely and hack your friends in order to push yourself to victory!

---
## Game Objectives
Your goal is to beat "The Game" before anyone else in your LAN party does.  In order to do so, you must have a careful balance of installing Mods (that can make the game easier but less rewarding, or harder and more rewarding) and moving spaces.

In "The Game", enemies and bosses appear that you must defeat to progress and will give you coins.  
> See Section 'Gameplay Info > Coins' for more information

Everyone's computers have the ability to install Mods on your system, making you more powerful.  You can also grief your "friends" by giving them viruses!
> See Section 'Gameplay Info > Mods' for more information

If your computer has too many Mods installed on it, it can crash, reverting your progress to the last saved location in "The Game".
    > See Section 'Gameplay Info > Crashing' for more information

---
## Starting Gameplay
1. In order of how expensive a player's real life computer costs, each player picks a computer to use for the game
2. Each player draws 3 Mods from the deck, can install one for free (or keep it in their 'Mods Folder'), and then the rest are shuffled back into the deck. If a Mod is installed this way, ignore the Bug Value roll.
    > See Section 'Gameplay Info > Mods Folder' for more information
3. Each player draws 3 System Settings cards rom the deck into their hand.
4. Each player gets 5 coins and puts them in their 'Reliable' coins space
5. One (1) Boss monster is drawn and placed face down on the boss monster spaces on the player's board

---
## Gameplay Loop
**Starting Phase:**

Starting with the player with the worst computer, that player chooses to either enter the play phase, or skip it and go to the maintenance phase.

**Play Phase:**

Players roll their movement dice and move that many spaces in "The Game".  A Player cannot move backwards during this phase, only 0.  During the play phase, if any bosses are run into, the character stops and has to fight the enemy.
> See Section 'Gameplay Info > Battles' for more information
If the player starts on a boss square, no movement roll is required and they start fighting right away.

**Event Phase:**

After movement, the character lands on a space, draws a card from the 'Event Deck' and performs any actions required (saving, installing/uninstalling Mods, fighting, etc).
The event phase does not activate if the character does not move, or stops on a Boss Space.

**Maintenance Phase:**

After performing space actions, the player is then able to purchase Mods, install or uninstall Mods, activate cards, configure system settings, soft reset, and end their turn (per computer specs).
> See Section 'Gameplay Info > Computers' and 'Gameplay Info > Maintenance' for more information

**End Turn Phase:**
Temporary effects are removed from the player's board, and discarded.  The turn passes to the player to the left (clockwise).

Ending Cooperation:
    - Jolly Cooperation ends if any of the following happens:
        - If the boss dies, both players split the loot evenly but the helping player gets to draw an event card (can choose to use or discard it immediately), and a Mod card (can choose to install on OWN computer or put into Mod Folder)
