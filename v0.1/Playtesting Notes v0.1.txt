Board Game Goldfishing Balance Notes:
	Overall Game Feel:
		* Mods actually kind of cool to manage
		* System crash is strong but not too bad
		* Mods and System settings are too costly, maybe drop to 2 or 3
		* Monsters were never scary, only 1 boss gave me any sort of trouble
		* Remove hard cap every 20 spaces? 
	Character Balance:
		* Mage way too strong, maybe rebalance all classes to either 1d6 or 1d8 for movement and damage
		
Playtest With Fwiends
	'Cheat Engine' Feels Really Bad
		-Used as a Virus because of it's negative effect
	Move Single Use To Instant Speed
		- or maybe not
		- cards shouldn't be able to 'counter' on other peoples turns
		- getting a firewall in response to a virus is not fun
		- maybe move firewall action to 'bandwidth' economy?  opportunity cost for protecting yourself
	'No UI' Needs to have it's Installed Value Reduced (Or Maybe DMG Buff?)
	Support for 'Quicksave' mod spaces (i.e. hard to save on 25 or 47 or whatever)
	Card cost is way too low, needs to be upped to 5
		- Or maybe have a hand limit (5)
		- Must discard BEFORE drawing an addition
	Can sell mods on 'the internet' for 2
		-Mods go from your mods folder and get discarded during this action
	Less 'Kali Linux VMs'
	Add card to remove negative effect of a single card
	'Nude Mod' needs to only affect coins gathered from monsters
	'Spyware' should only be able to play 1 card per turn from opp hand
	'Hand-Me-Down' Changed to 'MAY FLIP A COIN'
	All Bosses need a plus damage buff or a plus health buff for a clock of 2/3 turns preferably.
	'Infinite Money' needs higher install cost
		- Downside needs to be removed
	Fix the board, needs better visibility on the installed/uninstalled mods
	Create virus that can be played over firewalls
		- Backdoor / Spectre / Meltdown (?)
	'Difficulty Mod' needs additional boss damage
	'Cheat' cards need more installed resources
	'Cheat' cards need system settings to counter
	'Checkpoint' mechanics for EVERYONE
		- on a gameboard where all checkpoints are the same
	More movement modifiers on mods (almost all of them)
		+ Movement with - damage, + enemy health, + enemy dmg
		- Movement with +damage, - enemy health or dmg
	Reduce number of dice and 
		Hero abilities or hero stats on card to weight the roll to favor the playstyle
		reduce board size? can make it much smaller and use a smaller die for everything 
	
	Explore 'Bandwidth' concept
		- Instead of set number of actions per turn, have a 'bandwidth' value that limits actions
		- Certain actions cost more bandwidth than others
	Work on balancing action and coin economy
