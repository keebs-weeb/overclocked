Reduce player board space
Limit mods in some way to aim for 4/5 total mods per computer
	- reduce computer resources?
	- set up certain # of mod spaces?
	- change mods to fall into more categories (from just gameplay/cheat/virus)
		- Utility
		- Items/Collectables
		- Gameplay
		- Audio/Textures
		- World
		- NPC
		- Weapons/Armor
		- Economy/Vendors
	- change rules to only be able to install 1 mod of each type at a time (have to use different mods)

	Make everything based off of d12
	Including mod rolls, enemy health, etc
	No mods installed L1 Boss: 60% winrate (swordsman base)
	No mods installed L1 Normal Monsters: 80% winrate (swordsman base)
	
	Upon testing, 1 point of health is worth about 25% of 1 point of damage
