## Game Summary
Grab your favorite computer and play "The Game" with your friends!  First one to beat the game wins, so install Mods wisely and hack your friends in order to push yourself to victory!

---
## Game Objectives
Your goal is to beat "The Game" before anyone else in your LAN party does.  In order to do so, you must have a careful balance of installing Mods (that can make the game easier but less rewarding, or harder and more rewarding) and moving spaces.

In "The Game", enemies and bosses appear that you must defeat to progress and will give you coins.  
> See Section 'Gameplay Info > Coins' for more information

Everyone's computers have the ability to install Mods on your system, making you more powerful.  You can also grief your "friends" by giving them viruses!
> See Section 'Gameplay Info > Mods' for more information

If your computer has too many Mods installed on it, it can crash, reverting your progress to the last saved location in "The Game".
    > See Section 'Gameplay Info > Crashing' for more information

---
## Starting Gameplay
1. In order of how expensive a player's real life computer costs, each player picks a computer to use for the game
2. Each player draws 3 Mods from the deck, can install one for free (or keep it in their 'Mods Folder'), and then the rest are shuffled back into the deck. If a Mod is installed this way, ignore the Bug Value roll.
    > See Section 'Gameplay Info > Mods Folder' for more information
3. Each player draws 3 System Settings cards rom the deck into their hand.
4. Each player gets 5 coins and puts them in their 'Reliable' coins space
5. One (1) Boss monster is drawn and placed face down on the boss monster spaces on the player's board

---
## Gameplay Loop
**Starting Phase:**

Starting with the player with the worst computer, that player chooses to either enter the play phase, or skip it and go to the maintenance phase.

**Play Phase:**

Players roll their movement dice and move that many spaces in "The Game".  A Player cannot move backwards during this phase, only 0.  During the play phase, if any bosses are run into, the character stops and has to fight the enemy.
> See Section 'Gameplay Info > Battles' for more information
If the player starts on a boss square, no movement roll is required and they start fighting right away.

**Event Phase:**

After movement, the character lands on a space, draws a card from the 'Event Deck' and performs any actions required (saving, installing/uninstalling Mods, fighting, etc).
The event phase does not activate if the character does not move, or stops on a Boss Space.

**Maintenance Phase:**

After performing space actions, the player is then able to purchase Mods, install or uninstall Mods, activate cards, configure system settings, soft reset, and end their turn (per computer specs).
> See Section 'Gameplay Info > Computers' and 'Gameplay Info > Maintenance' for more information

**End Turn Phase:**
Temporary effects are removed from the player's board, and discarded.  The turn passes to the player to the left (clockwise).

    - In this mode, both hosting player and helping player take turns giving and receiving hits
    - Any Active Effects such as potions WILL be used, as this counts as an encounter
    - Only the mods active on the Hosting player's computer are used

Requesting Cooperation:
    - Jolly Cooperation can be requested for boss fights, but other players don't have to take up the requesting player.
    - If multiple people offer their assistance, then priority is given as follows:
        - Lowest Level Player
        - Player Winning a High Roll

Modified Combat Order:
    - Helping player rolls their dice and deals damage to the enemy
    - The enemy deals a static damage value to helping player

    - The enemy deals a static damage value to hosting player
    - This continues until either the Hosting player dies or the boss is defeated
    - After combat (win or lose), the player is healed to full health

Ending Cooperation:
    - Jolly Cooperation ends if any of the following happens:
        - If the boss dies, both players split the loot evenly but the helping player gets to draw an event card (can choose to use or discard it immediately), and a Mod card (can choose to install on OWN computer or put into Mod Folder)
        - If the hosting player dies, the hosting player suffers the failures and all costs associated with it.  The helping player suffers no consequences.
        - If the helping player dies, they suffer no consequences and combat for the player whose turn it is continues as normal.

    - Purchase a Mod card for 5 coins (Up From 3 coins)
-Purchase System Settings
    - Purchase a System Settings card for 5 coins (Up From 3 coins)
```

#### Bandwidth
```
NEW MECHANIC
Description: 
    - During each maintenance phase and lasting until their next turn, players have a certain amount of 'Bandwidth' they can use to perform actions
    - Bandwidth is refreshed at the start of a player's maintenance phase
    - The amount of bandwidth is the same between all players, and starts at 5
    - Different actions cost different amounts of bandwidth to perform, described below

Action Cost:
    - 1 Bandwidth:
        - Drawing a Mod card
        - Draing a System Settings card
        - Installing a System Settings card on your computer
        - Selling a card to 'The Forums'
        - Installing a mod on another player's computer (this is in addition to the bandwidth cost of the card played)
    - 2 Bandwidth:
        - Installing a System Setting card on another player's computer
    - Varying Bandwidth:
        - Installing a mod costs X bandwidth, where X is half the value (rounded up) of the Installed System Resources value
        - System Settings each have their own bandwidth cost

Dev Notes:
    - This system will take a lot of balancing and number tweaking.
```

#### Saving
```
- Removed the concept of per player saving
- Players now save at each 'checkpoint' that are located at static positions throughout the game board
- Checkpoints are now every 10 spaces on the board
- Players can choose which checkpoint to revert to
- Players can only save on a boss space after that boss has been defeated
```

#### Coins
```
- Coins in each player's bags are now split into 2 categories: 'reliable' and 'unreliable'
- 'Reliable' coins cannot be lost upon player defeat, but are still lost on system crash
- 'Unreliable' coins are all lost upon player defeat, and upon system crash
- When gathered by any means, all coins are 'unreliable'
- Coins become 'reliable' when the player passes a checkpoint
- Players may spend coins from either section when purchasing mods
- Players may now gain coins from selling Mod and System Settings cards to 'The Forums'
```
